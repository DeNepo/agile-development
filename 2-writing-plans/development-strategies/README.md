# Development Strategies

Development Strategy files are something you will use for your entire time at
HYF. As you build larger projects and learn JavaScript your development
strategies will grow with you. Practicing now with small projects using only
HTML & CSS will prepare you for collaborating on larger and more complex
projects later on.

Here's a suggestion for how you can study these exercises:

1. **Study the Final Code:** Start off by understanding the web page you want to
   rebuild. Read the code, open it the browser, study the web page in the Dev
   Tools, make small changes and see what happens.
2. **Write User Personas:** Think about who would want to use this web page and
   why. Describe these users by writing User Personas.
3. **Write a README:** Once you understand the web page, write a full README to
   describe who it's for and why they would to visit the page.
4. **Write a Prioritized Backlog:** Break down the website into user stories
   prioritized by `must-have`, `should-have` and `could-have`. Be sure to use
   the "_as a ... I want to ... so that ..._" format, and to include acceptance
   criteria for each user story.
5. **Write a Dev Strategy for the Must-Have User Stories:** Write a concrete
   plan for how you could implement each of the `must-have` user stories. This
   should include all the code and assets needed to meet each story's acceptance
   criteria.
6. **Develop the Must-Have User Stories:** Figure out how you could go from an
   empty boiler plate project to the final code by following your development
   strategy. It's ok to copy-paste the just code you need for each step out of
   the `/final-code` folder. If you're looking for an extra challenge, try
   writing your own new code for each step in your strategy!
7. **Should-Haves and Could-Haves:** After you've finished your `must-have` user
   stories you can either reconstruct the rest of your backlog, or move on to
   the next exercise.

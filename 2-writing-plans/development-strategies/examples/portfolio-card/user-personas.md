## Current Colleague

- **Bio**: Patricia works on the CI pipeline at Amazon. Her work is
  cross-cutting so she often has to collaborate with developers from every
  division of the company.
- **Needs/Goals**: Patricia needs to keep track of everyone she works with,
  remembering names and faces is important for her work.
- **Frustrations**: There are so many employees at Amazon, and Patricia spends
  so much time working with different teams that it's hard to keep track of
  everyone.
- **Scenario 1**: Patricia has been assigned a new project to update the unit
  testing infrastructure for the Amazon login portal. Angela is the lead
  developer on the login portal team, Patricia would look to know a little about
  Angela before they meet for the first time in person.
- **Scenario 2**: A month after the project is finished Patricia needs to check
  in with Angela to see if everything is still working as expected. This
  portfolio card will also be a helpful reminder before their meeting scheduled
  on Tuesday.

  person right after work.

  likes coffee and is interested in coding with him after work.
- **Scenario 1**: Rodolf finally remembers there's an employee portal with all
  Amazon developers. He logs in, searches for "coffee" and finds Angela. He
  finds her on Reddit and sends her a message. The rest is history â˜•.

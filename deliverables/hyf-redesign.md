Can your group write a better home page than we have? Starting with nothing but
boilerplate code you'll build your own home page for
[HackYourFuture Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be).

When planning and developing always keep the user in mind, here's a few helpful
questions to guide your group:

- Who is this website for?
- Why are they visiting it?
- Which sections are most meaningful for them?

You'll probably discover that there's more than 1 audience for this web page. A
student, a coach, and a sponsor will all visit the site but for different
reasons. Which sections are most important for each user? How will you
prioritize each user in your backlog and development strategy?

Careful! When you inspect the hackyourfuture.be the DOM, HTML and CSS will be
complicated nonsense. The class names will be meaningless, there will be many
extra nested elements, and the sources will be split into many strange files.
Ignore this! You aren't trying to recreate the exact code (which is actually
[written in React](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/hackyourfuture.be/tree/main/src)).

When writing your code pay special attention to:

- Not using Bootstrap, SASS, or anything other than plain CSS.
- [HTML/CSS Good Practice](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/12-principles-for-keeping-your-code-clean/)
- Using HTML5 Semantic Element
- Responsive Design

Copy-paste this checklist into a new _deliverables_ issue and move your issue to
the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `deliverable`
- milestone: Agile Development

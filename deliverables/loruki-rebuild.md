This project's goal is to work as a group studying and reconstructing the
[**loruki-website** tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website)
from Traversy Media. Your group is not expected to submit exactly the same code
as Mr. Traversy. You are free to add features, remove features, or write your
features differently than he did.

This is a large project to finish in one week, it's ok if you don't develop
everything you planned. It's even ok if you didn't merge any PRs! What's most
important is that your `/planning` folder and project board are well done, and
that your group had good discipline with branching and code review.

Here's a good way to approach the group project:

1. Before watching the tutorial video complete these steps of
   [planning-and-collaborating](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/planning-and-collaborating)
   as a group:
   - **Repo Setup**, **Project Definition**, **Constraints**, **Communication
     Plan**
   - **User Personas**: Decide who the target users are for this web page, and
     how it helps them.
   - **Backlog**: Study the finished website as a group to come up with your
     backlog of user stories and priorities. You won't need to look at the
     actual code for this step, backlogs are all about what the user sees!
   - **Design**: Study the finished website as a group, comparing it to the
     backlog you wrote. How would you simplify the website into a wireframe?
   - **Development Strategy**: Study the finished code as a group. What code did
     Mr. Traversy write for each step? how would you break that code into
     different tasks?
   - **Project Board**: Convert your Development Strategy into issues and a
     project board in your group repo.
2. While studying the tutorial individually, each group member can assign
   themselves tasks from the project board to practice the HTML & CSS they are
   learning in the tutorial.
3. After everyone has finished studying the tutorial you can already organize a
   group call to discuss what you learned and write your **Retrospective**. Your
   group does not need to have finished the project before doing the
   Retrospective.

Copy-paste this checklist into a new _deliverables_ issue and move your issue to
the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `deliverable`
- milestone: Agile Development

```md
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_) (GitHub Pages, not Netlify)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] user personas
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] design
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```

> PS. In the tutorial, Mr. Traversy deploys his website using Netlify. Your
> group should use GitHub Pages instead.

# All About Trees

> - _Following Plans_
> - [HTML & CSS template repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css)

This project is to rebuild the _All About Trees_ site in a new repository as a
group using the Planning and Collaborating workflows. Many of the planning
documents are already started for you in this folder. Your group will use them
as a starting point to plan your own rebuild of the site.

You _will not_ be planning a new website, and you _will not_ be trying to build
the most beautiful page possible. Your main focus should be the steps in
[Planning and Collaborating](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/planning-and-collaborating),
Git/GitHub workflows, and code review using a checklist.

Later you’ll get the chance to be creative and plan full websites from scratch.
For now you should just focus on learning the workflows and processes so you’re
more free to be creative in the future.

## Starter Materials

This folder has starter materials for this the All About Trees page, you can
copy-paste these files into your repository's `/planning` folder:

- **[./planning/user-personas.md](./planning/user-personas.md)**: A description
  of your website's users and their motivations.
- **[./planning/backlog.md](./planning/backlog.md)**: The prioritized list of
  user stories in your project.
- **[./planning/design.md](./planning/design.md)** &
  **[./planning/wireframe.svg](./planning/wireframe.svg)**: A wireframe and some
  explanation of the site's design.
- **[./planning/development-strategy.md](./planning/development-strategy.md)**:
  A high-level plan for the steps you will use while building the site, and what
  code you might need for each step. This is a living document! You don't need
  to make a perfect plan from the beginning, and your team should adjust the
  strategy during development if something isn't working.

This file will help you figure out how to convert your `development-strategy.md`
into issues, labels and milestones:

- **[./issues.md](./issues.md)**: A suggestion for issues you can put on your
  project board.

And these files contain the finished code & assets your group will be
reconstructing one Pull Request at a time. You _should not_ copy-paste these
files directly into the repository. Instead each group member will contribute a
small part of the code one PR at a time until the entire site has been
reassembled on the `main` branch:

- **[./index.html](./index.html)**
- **[./styles.css](./styles.css)**
- **[./happy-tree.jpg](./happy-tree.jpg)**

You don't like something about the web page? No problem! You're encouraged to
make any changes to the plan or code as long as your whole team agrees.

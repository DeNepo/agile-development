## During Class

Begin the [Loruki Rebuild](../deliverables/loruki-rebuild.md) deliverable.

### Before Break

- _20 min_: Form random groups and study the `/development-strategy` examples
  from Chapter 2 together [here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/agile-development/tree/master/2-writing-plans/development-strategies/examples/portfolio-card):
  - How do you write a _User Persona_?
  - How do you write a _User Story_?
  - How do you _Prioritize a Backlog_?
  - How do you write a _Development Strategy_?
  - How do you _follow_ a Development Strategy?
- _60 min_: In your groups try to complete one of the `/development-strategy`
  exercises. [here](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/agile-development/tree/master/2-writing-plans/development-strategies/exercises)
- _20 min_: Get back together as a class:
  - each group will quickly present what they worked on
  - full-class discussion

### After Break

- _70 min_: Form random groups and begin preparing for the week's deliverable.

  Study the [Loruki page](https://zen-carson-c10c9f.netlify.app/) together:

  - Who is this website for? (_User Personas_)
  - Why are they visiting it? (_User Stories_)
  - Which interactions are most meaningful for them? (_Prioritized Backlog_)

  By the end of class you should try to complete:

  - Repository Setup
  - Project Definition
  - Constraints
  - Communication Plan

  And have started your:

  - User Personas
  - Backlog
  - Prioritized Design

- _20 min_: Regroup and have each group give a quick presentation:
  - how far did you make it?
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - any tips to share?

## After Class

Study the `/development-strategies` folder in
[/2-writing-plans](../2-writing-plans)

In your groups, try to complete the
[Loruki Rebuild](../deliverables/loruki-rebuild.md) deliverable. If you are not
able to complete everything that's ok! You should still complete a
_Retrospective_ and move your issue to _Ready for Review_ before the next class.

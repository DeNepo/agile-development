# Being Agile

So far you have built small sites in short periods of time. Your plans have been
pretty complete and you were (mostly) able to build exactly what you planned.
This is not reality!

In real development projects you will constantly need to adapt your plans as you
go. There are many reasons for this, and many of them are out of your control:
The client may ask for something different, you may realize something is much
more difficult than you thought, a colleague may fall ill.

In this lesson you will hear from your coaches about times they have had to
change plans mid-project, and will get begin developing a larger website of your
own.

## During Class

### Before Break

- _20 min_: Review and Q/A
- _30 min_: Discuss the challenges of planning larger software projects, and how
  to successfully adapt your plans when necessary
  - Ask many questions to learn from your coaches' experience!
- _10 min_: Form random groups and study the
  [HackYourFuture Belgium home page](https://hackyourfuture.be/) together:
  - Who is this website for? (_User Personas_)
  - Why are they visiting it? (_User Stories_)
  - Which interactions are most meaningful for them? (_Prioritized Backlog_)
- _30 min_: In your groups write down some ideas for:
  - User Personas
  - User Stories
  - A Prioritized Backlog
- _20 min_: Get back together as a class:
  - each group will quickly present what they wrote and take any questions
  - full-class discussion
- _10 min_: Recap

### After Break

- _70 min_: Go directly to your small groups and begin preparing for the week's
  deliverable. You should try to complete:

  - Repository Setup
  - Project Definition
  - Constraints
  - Communication Plan

  And have a first-draft for:

  - User Personas
  - Backlog
  - Prioritized Design

- _20 min_: Regroup and have each group give a quick presentation:
  - how far did you make it?
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - any tips to share?

## After Class

In your groups, try to complete the
[HYF Re-Design](../deliverables/hyf-redesign.md) deliverable. If you are not
able to complete everything that's ok! You should still complete a
_Retrospective_ and move your issue to _Ready for Review_ before the next class.

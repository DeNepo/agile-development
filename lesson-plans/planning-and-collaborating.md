  intro & chapter 1
  - Being agile is about learning from mistakes and constantly improving, all
    the details exist to make that possible
  - The most important part of an agile project is the _retrospective_, it's
    when you learn from your mistakes and make better plans for the future
  - During this module, your group's retrospective will be the _most important_
    deliverable!

### Before Break

  - Ask many questions to learn from your coaches' experience!
- _30 min_: Create random small groups and read through
  [planning-and-collaborating](https://github.com/DeNepo/planning-and-collaborating)
- _25 min_: all together:
  - Each group presents what was most unexpected for them
  - Q/A with the coaches

### After Break

- _10 min_: All together, read through the
  [All About Trees](../deliverables/all-about-trees)
- _60 min_: Return to your small groups and begin working on this week's
  deliverable with the help of your coaches. Your group should try to complete:
  - Repository Setup
  - Project Definition
  - Constraints
  - Communication Plan
- _20 min_: Recap from each group and Q/A

## After Class

In your groups, try to complete the
[All About Trees](../deliverables/all-about-trees) deliverable. If you are not
able to complete everything that's ok! You should still complete a
_Retrospective_ and move your issue to _Ready for Review_ before the next class.
